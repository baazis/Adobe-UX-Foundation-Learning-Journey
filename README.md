    What Is a Sitemap, and what Is Included?

    > It’s possible to define two types of sitemaps—a visual sitemap that you create before building a website and an XML file that contains a list of the pages on your website.
    > Visual sitemaps are a hierarchical diagram that shows the Information Architecture of a website. It gives you a visual representation of the site’s organization and how different sections are linked together.
    > Sections can contain other sections or nodes (atomic unit of content). In this section, we'll explore what is involved in creating a sitemap, and explore some examples.
